  p.lead August 12th, 13th & 14th, 2015 in Minneapolis, Minnesota!

  p Midwest JS is a premier technology conference focused on the JavaScript ecosystem. The conference was a tremendous success last year and we hope to make it even better in 2015! The conference will be held in downtown Minneapolis at the University of St. Thomas.

  p There will be a variety of talks from well­known speakers in the community in a typical presentation format. Talks are categorized and structured based on the following tracks:

  ol
    li Beginner Track (JavaScript fundamentals, jQuery, jQuery UI, etc.)
    li Frameworks Track (Angular.js, Knockout.js, Ember.js, Backbone.js, etc.)
    li Node Track (anything based on Node.js)
    li Mobile­ Track (PhoneGap, Appcelerator, etc.)
    li Testing Track (TDD, Jasmine, etc.)
    li Miscellaneous Track (Anything that doesn't fit into the others)

  p There will be a social activity for all conference attendees and sponsors in the evening on August 13th after the talks are done for the day. The exact details around the social activity are still in the works.
