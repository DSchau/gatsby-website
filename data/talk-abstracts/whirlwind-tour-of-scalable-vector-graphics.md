In this session, we'll walk through the essential building blocks of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). Then we’ll dive into transforms and matrices and how to manage the transform stack. We'll also learn how to script against SVG with JavaScript libraries like Raphaël and D3 to make interactive web applications.

* Introduction to SVG elements
* Benefits of using SVG
* The different ways to embed SVG
* Scripting SVG
* Using SVG links
* SVG filters
* Using CSS Animation with SVG
* CSS Transforms and Transform Matrices
* RaphaelJS – Primitives, Attributes, Events, Animation and Easing, Sets and Transforms
* Other Cool SVG Stuff (Links and Demos)

This talk is adapted from my previous talk on [SVG and RaphaelJS](http://www.slideshare.net/1Marc/svg-and-raphael-js), though I intend to dive more into SVG transforms and less into RaphaelJS. I also did a quick blog post detailing many of the [links and some of the demos](http://marcgrabanski.com/interactive-vector-graphics) from the talk.
