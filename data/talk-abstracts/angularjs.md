During an adventurous day-long workshop, we will build a fully-functional single page application using:
* Grunt to automate tasks in our build process.
* AngularJS, the superheroic framework.
* Karma test framework to practice TDD.
* Less for CSS preprocessing.
* ..and many other JS tools.

During the workshop, we will discuss the different technologies and then write the code to make the application bend to our will. It will be a fast paced course progressively covering each of these technologies with labs that will give you enough experience to prepare for a deep dive.

A fully RESTful api written with Node and Express4 will be provided so that we can connect our application to an in-memory database. What you will need: a laptop, with admin or sudo rights, Node, Npm, and Git installed on said laptop, your favorite editor for your JavaScripts (Webstorm, Sublime Text, Atom, Vim), a modern browser (no IE 8-9 please) and coffee.
