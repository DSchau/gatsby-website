NativeScript is a free and open source JavaScript framework for building native iOS, Android, and Windows Phone apps. But I know what you're thinking: another way of building apps? What makes NativeScript special? Here are a few cool things: * Direct access to native APIsÃ¢â‚¬â€no plugins required. Want to create a file on Android? Run new java.io.File()Ã¢â‚¬â€in JavaScript! * Completely native performance through the use of a JavaScript bridge natively available on all three mobile platforms. * Cross-platform libraries for common use cases. Need to call a JSON API? Run http.getJSON("https://api.mydomain.com/get"). * Style native apps using CSS. Yep, that's actually a thing. Curious about how it all works? Come learn! Architectures will be explained; apps will be built; and fun will be had by all.
