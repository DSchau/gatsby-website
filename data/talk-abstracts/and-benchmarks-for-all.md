If you're a framework maintainer it is really hard to measure performance of your library and it can be a real pain in the butt. This talk will show you how to write different kinds of benchmarks (certainly, not micro benchmarks), including the ones that will profile DOM interactions and JavaScript execution. Ember.js will be taken as a playground for showing different benchmarks' demos And benchmarks for all!
