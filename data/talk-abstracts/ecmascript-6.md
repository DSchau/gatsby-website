EcmaScript 6 (a.k.a. ES6 / ES 2015) brings a ton of awesome new features to the table. In this training, we'll learn about the features you're likely to use and benefit from on a day-to-day basis. In the afternoon, we'll take an existing application and update it to leverage these features using with modern tools like BabelJS. My goal is that after this training, you'll be able to go back to your projects and add these tools so you can write ES6 code today.
