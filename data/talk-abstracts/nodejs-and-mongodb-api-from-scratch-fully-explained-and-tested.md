I'll fully explain what Node.js is, how it works and most importantly discuss the pros and cons of it vs something like C# or Java from real world experience using all of them. Same will be done for MongoDB vs. traditional SQL. We will then build out (from scratch) a Node/MongoDB API application paying careful attention to common pitfalls (like dealing with async code) to learn tips and tricks along the way. Weâ€™ll then cover integration testing to make sure everything works. Expect to leave the talk feeling confident when and why to use this tech stack and how to get started quickly!
