The services being built are related to IoT and leverage Docker

1. Overview of the architecture, presentation on the libraries and end goals
2. Setting up environment, making sure everyone has workshop and docker running
3. Building/running front-end (built on hapi)
4. Wiring up the system to influx db in a docker container
5. Adding services, and building a docker container to run each service
6. Using fuge to develop services
7. Running everything with docker-compose

The workshop will teach participants about docker and how to design services for docker using fuge.  It has a front-end and services for IoT sensors and devices that we will connect to in development.  At the end, participants should be comfortable developing microservices with Node.js using Seneca, and taking those services into a QA or Production environment.
