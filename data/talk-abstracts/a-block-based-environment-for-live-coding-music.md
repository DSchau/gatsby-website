There are a number of live coding environments for creating music.  The vast majority of these require the user to be able to read and write and to be able to understand complex syntax.

Scratch is a very popular environment for kids to learn how to code.  It uses blocks rather than words to indicate commands.  This reduces the amount of reading and typing a child has to do and adds a visual element to creating code.

What if we combine the ease of use of a block based programming environment with live coding of music?

Using the combination of Snap (a JavaScript clone of Scratch) plus Tone.js, I’m building a live coding environment for music that kids can use.  I will discuss my motivation for building this tool, discuss and demo a couple of iterations of the tool, talk about the various issues I had to work through with Snap and Tone.js, and also what I’d like to add to the tool to make it better.

The current version of this new environment can be found at http://www.fradkin.com/snap-music.html
