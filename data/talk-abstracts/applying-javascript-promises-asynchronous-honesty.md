Ready your poker faces to call the bluffs of JavaScript's asynchronous hand as we delve into the various use cases developers commonly come up against. Asynchronicity and all the of the side effects of callbacks are commonplace in the JavaScript world. To combat and simplify this problem, JavaScript pulled in the power of the Promise: a handshake used to bring visual synchronous sanity to a subtly asynchronous platform. Plan to come and learn various applications of the promise pattern, as well as a brief introduction to the various libraries available today. With promises, we'll explore through the benefits and pains that come with raw asynchronous call structure, as well as a brief breakdown of the typical promise API. We'll walk through three degrees of implementation that can be solved with promises. Finally, we'll observe the workflow of promises within simple synchronous use cases down to more dynamic complex call stacks. This discussion will focus on the Promise patterns' application, and not the Promise API in detail.
