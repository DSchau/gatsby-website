JavaScript has been the final Wild West of programming. But not anymore, with new libraries, frameworks, build systems, and dependency managers popping up seemingly every other week. This talk will be a light-hearted overview of the current state of JavaScript by looking at the landscape. What are all of these tools? What does it mean to be JavaScript developer in 2015? What does a developer need to know to be successful in this new, rapidly getting settled world that is the JavaScript ecosystem? We will solve all of the world's biggest problems, like Angular vs React and tabs vs. spaces. All of this will be mixed in with poor attempts at humor and lame, unrelated anecdotes.
