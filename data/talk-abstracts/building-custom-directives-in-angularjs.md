Custom directives in AngularJS 1.x are extremely powerful, offering the ability to create reusable, testable, components. This talk will do a deep dive via examples into how directives work in AngularJS. We will start by covering how directives work. We will then walk through examples of custom directives, starting with Hello World and working our way up to non-trivial examples. This talk will include when and how to restrict a directive to an element, an attribute, or a class. We will cover how and to manipulate scope to access and share the data that you wish to. During the entire talk, we will keep a focus on testing, showing in each case how to test the example, including accessing scope and externalizing templates.
