By now, most developers have heard of Node.js — the dominant "server-side JavaScript engine" — but many still haven't worked with it. Come listen, learn, and play along as we explore the world of Node. Attendees can expect answers to the following questions: - What is Node, really? - What is Node good for? What is Node exceptionally great for? - Why should I care about Node? Isn't it only used by "hipster" startups? I work in the enterprise! - How do I use Node? - How should I structure my Node application? - What is NPM? How do I use it? - Is there an analogous Node module to my beloved "Library XYZ" for .NET (or other languages/runtimes)? - Can I only use Node on the server-side? - ...and so much more! Attendees should have basic familiarity with the JavaScript language and how to use a command line (terminal).
