The web wasn't designed to be a platform for applications. The browser wasn't designed to be an application run time. And yet, the web tuned into the biggest, most universally accessible set of applications in computing's short history and the browser has many of the features you find in "native" application runtimes like iOS or Windows. Despite this, most web application developers (and the tools they use) are still hobbled by a mental model centered around the concept of a "page". This talk will explore how we built this mental model, how it's holding us back from creating the great experiences user's deserve, and how, with the adoption of tools like Grunt/Gulp/Broccoli, Bower/Component, and Ember/Angular/React, the development of web applications will increasingly feel like the development of native platform applications.
