Codecademy uses React.js in production for most of our frontend work. Learn about the tools we've built and the strategies we use to make our development team maximally effective. I will discuss using gulp for compilation and ES6-to-5 transpiling, server-side rendering using node.js, hot reloading with Webpack, and scripts for automatically generating new component boilerplate. I will conclude with a discussion of "tooling culture" and how you can best translate these examples to fit the needs of your own team.
