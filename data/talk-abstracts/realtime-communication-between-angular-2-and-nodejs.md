I will be demonstrating how to use Angular 2, Node.js, socket.io, and lodash to create a realtime system that allows users to update data in realtime. The system will include a simple login, a contacts list, and using two browsers I will demonstrate some of the advantages of realtime systems with regard to concurrency and consistency. Finally I will briefly describe the various locking strategies available in realtime systems.
