The key to understanding JavaScript's object model is understanding the prototype object, and thus prototypical inheritance. This talk will guide attendees through the prototype: how it is created, what it is, and how to use it in object-oriented JavaScript. We'll cover some related OOP concepts along the way like constructor methods, parent method calls, and mixins. By the end of this talk attendees will have a good core knowledge of JavaScript's prototype object and how to use it in object-oriented programming.
