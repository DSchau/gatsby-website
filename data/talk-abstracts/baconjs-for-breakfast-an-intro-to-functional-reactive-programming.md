Bacon.js is a library that has a familiar looking API (i.e. jQuery-like) that is simple enough to ease into Functional Reactive Programming, but powerful enough to use as the base for large, complicated applications. This talk will introduce the concepts of functional reactive programming like the core functional programming methods like "map" and "filter" and how to start thinking about streams of events instead of single event handlers. From there, we'll see how Bacon.js implements these concepts. And then dive into a few examples of how to write some basic components with Bacon.
