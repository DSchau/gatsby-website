Project Nashorn is the ECMAScript compiler and runtime for the JVM, new in Java SE 8. Nashorn is performant, compliant, and a formidable solution for polyglot development on the JVM platform. This talk will discuss and demonstrate strategies for developing rich, maintainable, testable, server-side JavaScript code for enterprise Java applications. There will be a focus on feature development, best practices, and Nashorn-backed frameworks (like Project Avatar).
