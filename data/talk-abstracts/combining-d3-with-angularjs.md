D3 is a powerful JS library utilizing SVG to create charts and graphs. However, it can be complicated. In this talk, I will demonstrate the basics of D3. Then I will show how we can utilize the powerful abstraction that we get with AngularJS to create custom, reusable directives based on the D3 library. After demonstrating how to do this, we will cover a couple existing libraries that do this for us, including the [angular-d3 project](https://github.com/robinboehm/angular-d3-directives) and the [angular-nvd3 project](https://github.com/cmaurer/angularjs-nvd3-directives). The latter is built on the [NVD3.js library](http://nvd3.org/), a collection of reusable charts based on D3, so we will do a quick overview of that as well.
