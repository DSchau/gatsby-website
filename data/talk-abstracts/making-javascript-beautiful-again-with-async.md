Nested promise chains getting you down? In callback hell?

Here's the good news: the same `async` and `await` operators that have made asynchronous programming a joy in other languages such as C# for years is slated to arrive in an upcoming version of JavaScript, and can be used today!

Could this mean the end of countless torturous hours trying to grok and debug asynchronous spaghetti code?

We will examine:
* How to use async/await to make your asynchronous code look synchronous
* Bringing sanity to difficult-to-follow promise chains
* Uses in both browser-based and Node.js contexts
* Demonstrations of a variety of applications such as ajax calls, delayed function execution, and animation sequences
* Using babel to harness this feature today, and real-world gotchas to be aware of
