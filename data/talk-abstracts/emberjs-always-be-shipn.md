Ember.js has your back, from prototype to production app. How is this possible? With strong ever improving conventions ember and the wider ecosystem of tools and add-ons work together to constantly deliver the best possible experience.

This talk aims to be interesting to all, from individuals merely curious about ember, to those who use ember on a daily bases.
