The Node.js movement has transformed the landscape of UI development. In this session weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll look at how Node.js can be leveraged on multiple layers of the web application development lifecycle. Attendees will learn how incorporating Node.js into your front-end build process can optimize code, allow you to use use new and upcoming JavaScript features in your code today, and to improve your asset delivery pipeline. This session will also cover how Node is changing the template rendering landscape, allowing developers to write "isomorphic" code that runs on the client and server. Lastly weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll look into using Node to achieve developer zen by keeping the codebase clean and limiting the risk of changes to the code causing unknown errors.
