Have you heard of the "event loop" but not sure why its important? Wondering if Node.js is ready for the enterprise (spoiler alert: yes it is!)? Want to leverage your front-end skills and go full-stack? If you answered yes to any of these questions, this Node.js whirlwind introduction is for you!

In this workshop we'll introduce Node.js and its ecosystem, go over the basics of Node.js development, and discuss the benefits (and pitfalls) of writing asynchronous code. Finally, we'll take a look at some of IBM's enterprise-grade tools for deploying, scaling, and monitoring your Node.js application.

## Agenda (*tentative*)
