We often say, "pick the right tool for the job," because the web is so versatile and projects fall across a wide spectrum of complexity. Big frameworks are often overkill for simple scenarios, and micro libraries fall apart when complexity compounds. Ecosystem around a view layer as core seems to be the way forward, but rapid innovation without consensus leads to choice fatigue. Is it possible to create a "progressive framework" that offers a complete, but incrementally adoptable solution? I am going to demonstrate why I believe Vue.js could be one such framework.
