Sailjs is the most popular Nodejs MVC framework. This talk is to help you get a crash course in Sailsjs and hopefully learn some tricks early so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get stuck. I plan to give a little bit of an explanation on Waterline which is the ORM that Sailjs has baked right in. Prior to using Sailjs I had never used an ORM, so I'm hoping I can help you through some of the initial ORM hurdles.
