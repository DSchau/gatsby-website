I'd like to teach you all how Angular and Ember approximate web components, and in the process, bring you to a love of Ember unseen since Leo sank into his watery grave for Kate. Angular has directives and Ember has components; they very equivalent features but one has a more elegant API. Once we have a basic understanding of what directives and components bring to the table, I'll explain why Ember Components are awesome, unbelievably useful, and unparalleled in expressivity.
