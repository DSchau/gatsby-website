Cutting edge is awesome... but often not applicable to our real-world, in the trenches jobs.

Or an angular app that seems to be bursting at the seams? I'll demo & describe methods for incremental change, as opposed to the greenfield rewrite (holy grail) that rarely gets approved (and when it does, is rarely executed well).
