The Web is the universal platform, and Firefox OS is a mobile operating system built on those same open web technologies. The entire user interface, from lock screen to notification drawer to dialer is built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which means you can live-debug and edit your phone's UI with the normal Firefox dev tools. Oh, and the same goes for every single app. Firefox OS runs on [extremely inexpensive hardware](http://www.cnet.com/news/mozilla-launches-low-cost-firefox-os-phone-in-india), and has been put to use in rather [surprising](http://ee.telenor.io/gonzo/hardware/2014/12/16/firefox-os-iot.html) and [unexpected](http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/06/panasonic-firefox-os-deal) contexts. In addition to discussing how Firefox OS is built, this session will emphasize: - The Firefox OS development workflow, and the ways in which it differs from normal mobile web development. - How Firefox OS handles things that don't yet have a W3C standard, like enabling and tuning FM radios. - The "certified / priviledged / other" security model for system APIs on Firefox OS. - Using Cordova with Firefox OS. - App distribution methods on Firefox OS.
