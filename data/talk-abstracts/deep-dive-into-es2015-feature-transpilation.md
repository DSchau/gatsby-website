ES2015 provides a crazy amount of new tools that JS devs have been dreaming for years, but the problem is many browsers can't/won't support them, at least for a while. Transpilation into ES5 is a logical solution, but there are hidden costs to some features and some transpilers that can cause performance and page weight to rapidly grow out of control. We'll talk about what they're doing and why, and hopefully start a conversation about specific elements and behaviors of ES2015 you might to reconsider or avoid for the time being.
