Continuous integration ensures software's health with each each codebase change, ideally via automated tests and other quality-assurance processes. Tools like Phantomjs offer a great path towards headless JavaScript testing, but what about those scenarios where the software under test requires an actual GUI web browser?

In this talk, I'll offer some background on X Virtual Frame Buffer, and demo how to test a Google Polymer web component on a lightweight Ubuntu VM in continuous integration.
