Flow is a static type checker from Facebook. Flow was designed to quickly find errors in JavaScript applications. Using Flow type annotations in JavaScript applications allows for a mixture of dynamic typing provided natively by JavaScript along with compile time type-safety checks afforded to statically typed languages. Using Flow can allow you to catch errors in your programs before a browser refresh or hot-reload even occurs. In this talk I'll give an introduction to Flow and discuss how using Flow can help you improve your JavaScript.
