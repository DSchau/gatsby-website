Cycle.js is a Javascript framework that promotes separating logic from effects in your code. This allows you to write your application as composable, functional pieces that can be combined and extended like components in a circuit. Through switching out the input sources and output sinks, you have something that can interface with canvas, web audio, or your tests just as easily as the DOM. If youâ€™ve ever been wondered what Cycle.js is all about, or the exciting companion technologies that it employs, RxJS and virtual-dom, then this is the talk for you!
