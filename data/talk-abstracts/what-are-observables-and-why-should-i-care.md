In this talk, we'll learn about the next generation of asynchronous abstraction: Observables. Observables (and the #1 library RxJS) are being used everywhere, from Angular 2 to the data teams at Netflix & Microsoft.

We’ll talk about why observables stand out among the many asynchronous abstractions available to the JS developer. Finally, we’ll dive into two case studies in Observable use - one frontend, one backend.

Afterward, you'll be able to harness the power of RxJS to tame your wild asynchronous data flows, wherever you may reside on the stack.
