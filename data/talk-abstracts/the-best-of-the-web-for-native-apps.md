One of the great strengths of the web platform is the ability to improve your software every day. When the code in your version control system is better than what's deployed on your servers, you can update your application and provide your users with the best possible experience. Your freedom to control how your code is deployed allows you to provide customized experiences based on where users are located, conduct A/B tests, and evaluate a new feature with a limited audience before rolling it out to all of your user base. Native apps have traditionally not enjoyed these same benefits. While the tight platform integration and smooth user interfaces of native apps exceed what's possible in a web browser, the rapid deployment capabilities of web applications are sorely missed. What if updating your native mobile app was as easy as "git push"? What if you could test the conversion rate of a signup form in a new Android activity versus a custom pop-up? What if you could instantly fix a bug after receiving the first bad review? Modern mobile platforms are making this possible, and in this talk we'll show you how you can bring the agility of web application development to native apps.
