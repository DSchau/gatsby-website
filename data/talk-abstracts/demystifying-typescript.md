TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles into plain, human readable JavaScript that youâ€™re already writing. It brings together the best of modern strongly typed object-oriented languages like C# and still allows you to embrace the dynamic nature of JavaScript. AngularJS 2 is TypeScript-first. Visual Studio Code is a cross-platform IDE (written in TypeScript!) on Linux, Mac, and PC and provides first-class support for Node and TypeScript projects. TypeScript 1.7 brings us closer to EcmaScript 6 (aka EcmaScript 2015) parity. Intellisense, strong typing, generics, classes, interfaces, ES6 features, and more will be discussed. In this session, I'm going to demystify TypeScript and address common myths and general misconceptions I've heard when talking to fellow developers. I'll show you why TypeScript is an excellent way to organize (and maintain) application-scale JavaScript projects and why you should leverage it in your projects to make your life more productive and less stressful, something everyone can relate to. It's time to conquer your codebase.
