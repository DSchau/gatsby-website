Kirsten has created a system in node, available on Github, which interacts with Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, and Withings, to create a health tracking system. It will send nagging notes via SMS using Twilio, change the colors of a Philips hue lightbulb based on progress for the day, and interact with any other API-driven service. Examples of all of these will be shared with you! What Gets Measured Gets Done!
