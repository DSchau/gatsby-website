Presently hybrid apps are at the forefront of the mobile development discussion. When done properly they allow for a shared code base between iOS and Android apps, web developers the opportunity to put their front end skills to use for mobile development and the ability to reuse any number of previously created HTML/CSS/JS components The problem is that building them requires a different way of thinking and a new set of tools. During the creation of the new ReachLocal app, both of these things were developed. The standard "single page app" approach was ditched and the Cordova Framework was extended to produce the Liger framework, which can truly be called hybrid. The presentation will cover this framework, complete with code samples and an example of a published application.
