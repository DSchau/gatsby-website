Making a website or application accessible can be an overwhelming task for a lot of developers, especially if you’re not already an expert. Looking at all the complex regulations, specs, and articles on the topic, where should we begin? In this talk, I’ll walk through some of the challenges I faced when working through accessibility requirements for the first time. I’ll cover basic considerations, how design and content fit in, testing advice, and introduce Aria practices. Attendees will leave knowing some of the practical constraints and tools that can make a big difference for users, and will have a starting point of how to make their next project more accessible. By thinking about accessibility as we would any other feature, it becomes less of a scary unknown requirement, and instead something we can plan for and implement to create a more open web for all.
