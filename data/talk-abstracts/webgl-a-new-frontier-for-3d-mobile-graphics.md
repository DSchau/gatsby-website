In-browser 3D graphics are the exclusive domain of desktop web browsers no more! Mobile vendors have at last made WebGL a reality on recent versions of both the iOS and Android platforms. This opens up many new possibilities for developing web-based 3D games and applications that run straight from the browser. We will explore all that WebGL developers will need to know before leaping into mobile development, such as: How is the mobile implementation of WebGL different from desktop? Are there any limitations I should be aware of? When should I use WebGL instead of Unity or a native app? Can I still use my favorite WebGL wrapper library (such as Three.js)? Note that this is not meant as an introductory "how to develop in WebGL" talk; however, anyone wanting to learn more about WebGL's potential on mobile devices will find it valuable!
