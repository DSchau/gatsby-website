"The secret to building large apps is never build large apps. Break your applications into small pieces. Then, assemble those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application" -Justin Meyer

Webpack was created to enable this. Come learn what Webpack and its wealth of plugins and functionality can do for your large app. When we’re done, you’ll want to migrate your monolithic gulp build.

JavaScript is changing rapidly and if you’re not building yours, you're seriously falling behind and missing out. More and more people are writing code that is transpiled first before it’s sent to the browser. This is not temporary, there will always be new features in JavaScript or CSS that we want to use today. With tools like BabelJS or TypeScript and CSS pre-processors we can deal with this, but how do you wire up this tooling in a way that's modular?

One of the great enemies to modularity is implicit dependencies. Many JavaScript applications have dependencies on some global state (you require some jQuery plugin or Angular module to be on the page first to work). We need something that allows us to declare our dependencies explicitly or our hair might just catch fire...

Enter Webpack. With amazing built-in functionality and a wealth of loaders and plugins, Webpack can allow you to take your complicated build process and simplify it all the while enabling modularity and pre-processing. But wait, there's more! Ever heard of CSS modules? Code splitting? Hot reloading? Come learn how Webpack uniquely makes these things possible.
