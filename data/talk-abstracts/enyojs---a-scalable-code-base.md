How do you make large maintainable applications out of JavaScript? Learn how you can leverage, what was originally intended to drive native JavaScript applications for embedded devices (Palm/HP devices, and LG SmartTVs) to help you attain a maintainable, reusable code base for multiple projects, widgets, applications, and libraries. Having a large codebase in JavaScript can be unwieldy. Many frameworks attempt to bridge the gap from un-maintainable to sustainable. Move beyond grouping files to; encapsulation, reusability and portability.
