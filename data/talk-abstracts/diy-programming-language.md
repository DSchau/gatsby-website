Are you tired of programming in JS? Are you pining to work in a locally-sourced, small-batch, micro-craft-brewed language? Do you have big ideas for the next great language that ushers in a new era of productivity? Or do you just want a DSL to solve your specific problem? IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m here to help. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explain how programming languages are transformed from text you edit to instructions that a computer can execute. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll introduce tools you can use to take advantage of this pipeline, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll work through a simple example of a small language that compiles to JS. By the end of this talk, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be ready to start making your artisanal programming language dreams come true!
