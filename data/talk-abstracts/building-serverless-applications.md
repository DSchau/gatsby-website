Tools like Amazon's Lambda and API Gateway are allowing us to create "serverless" systems. Finally, we are seeing the cloud live up its full potential. Massive on demand scalability, and no servers to worry about. At Bustle we are taking full advantage of this with our new infrastructure. On the backend, authorization, server sider rendering of javascript, database creates/updates, and search indexing are all handled by AWS Lambda. On the front end we are serving single page javascript applications, APIs, and static content all through API Gateway. Bringing these two technologies together has given us a truly instant-on platform without servers. And the best part? It is costing orders of magnitude less than our old EC2 based system. I'll walk attendees through our entire system so they can use some of these tools themselves. I'll also cover some common mistakes that are easy to make. Lastly, I'll talk about a few open source tools making it even easier to build these types of systems.
