Compared to native apps, mobile websites have historically been at a disadvantage: no installation, no push notifications, and they only work when you're online. This year, that changed. Browser vendors have worked together to implement open standards that address each of these shortcomings. This session examines how the Service Worker, Push, and App Manifest specifications fill the gap between web and native.

This talk will cover the essence of three new APIs, including:

1. How to use Service Workers as a programmable proxy / cache for your website, which allows you to make resources available offline.

2. How to use Push to send notifications to your website's users, even when they don't have your site open.

3. How to use a Web App Manifest to make your site installable, just like a native app.

We'll also discuss how, taken together, they allow us to create mobile web experiences that are virtually indistinguishable from native.
