[LoopBack](http://strongloop.com/mobile-application-development/loopback) is a JavaScript framework that makes connecting browsers and mobile apps to your backend data and services simple. It gives you tools for scaffolding Node.js REST APIs and browser clients, modeling data and relationships, exploring and testing your REST API, and quite a bit more. In this talk we'll cover LoopBack's independent modules, tools and features from a high level and dive deeper into using LoopBack's ability to share code between the browser and server.
