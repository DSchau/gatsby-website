The next version of JavaScript, defined by ECMAScript 6 (ES6), is packed with great, new features. There are many more significant additions than were provided in ES5. Firefox and Chrome are aggressively adding support for these and IE11 supports some, but it may be years before all popular browsers fully support ES6. The good news is that you don't have to wait to use ES6 features. You can use a transpiler today to convert ES6 code to ES5, enabling it to be run in current browsers and with Node.js. This process can be automated to occur whenever JavaScript file modifications are saved from any editor/IDE. This talk will describe tooling that enables this and provide an overview of many of the new features. These include modules, classes, arrow functions, default parameter values, destructuring, template strings, promises, generators, proxies and more. After hearing about these features, you won't want to wait to start using them!
