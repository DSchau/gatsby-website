JavaScript innovations in 2014 coalesced on a common theme: the public release of React.js, the announcments of the roadmaps for Ember and Angular 2.0, and Google betting big on Polymer, all emphasize that the future of the web lies in declarative components. This direction can seem radical and backwards to those of us with painful memories of inline event handlers and XML, who fear re-living the hell of tightly-coupled, unmaintainable code. This talk will focus on the real-world motivations behind this shift, and explain why 'ng-click' is not your grandma's onClick. I'll also discuss the popular (currently usable!) implementations of this philosophy, and how leveraging components can help keep you sane, regardless of your framework of choice.
