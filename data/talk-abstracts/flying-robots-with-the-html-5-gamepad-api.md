In this talk, developers will learn how to transform enterprise mobility using the HTML 5 gamepad API.  We will begin by exploring the current state of the union for browser support of gamepads before diving into the API its self.  We'll touch on a few notable gotchas across Mac and Windows platforms, and finish with a live demonstration of flying an Parrot AR Drone with our gamepad (input will be piped from the browser to node.js over a web socket).
